# Scriptingclass2023

Thank you guys for considering me for the 3D Animation and Game track at UVU! I am really passionate about creating 3D objects since I was in high school. I used to make some really silly statues with clay, and I made the desk that I did basically all of the work for the two classes you see here. I had a really rough time switching from my previous engineering degree to this one, but I think that I made the right call and I really enjoy all of the work that I have done so far and I would love to be able to do more. Even though this is my first exposure to coding and using game engines, I am really excited to see if I can make it in. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I hope that I can make a good impression with what I did over this semester!
